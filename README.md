Hello Readers,

In this blog, As a part curriculum, we need to build a Group project during construct week of every unit in Masai school. Currently, we all are in Unit-3 and here we are a team of 6 Developers. We need to develop a website similar to the main Website.

We took 5 days to build this website from the scratch and we have worked remotely yet effectively in doing so. I feel very happy to say that I got a team full of enthusiastic and energetic people, these are the people I worked with

What is Overstock?

Overstock.com, Inc. is an American internet retailer selling primarily furniture headquartered in Midvale, Utah, near Salt Lake City. Patrick M. Byrne founded Overstock.com in 1999. The company initially sold exclusively surplus and returned merchandise on an online e-commerce marketplace, liquidating the inventories of at least 18 failed dot-com companies at below-wholesale prices. The company continues to sell home decor, furniture, bedding, and many other goods that are closeout merchandise; however, it also sells new merchandise.

For building this application we used Following Tech Stack:
HTML5

CSS

JavaScript

ES6

DOM

Local Storage

Responsibilities and Listing of important features :
Every team member was given a specific set of tasks to be completed by the end of the day. We started by listing the pages that we will cover and presenting them. Each one of us was assigned at least two pages to cover from the website. As we didn’t have any APIs for this project we had to create our database. So for the first two days, we were collecting the data and kept adding it to our database. Once the database was done then we started working on the front end. Our first goal was to create a basic version of the page so that we can get the basic idea and implement them.

Following are page snippets of our application :
Home Page :



2. Ideas Page:



3. Login & Sign Up Page :


4. Furniture & Home Decor Page :



5. Product Page :


6. Cart Page :


7. Checkout & OTP Validation Pages :




Issues faced during the build week :
As this was our first build using MERN Stack we had a few issues but at the end of the day, we all together were able to solve almost all the issues that we came across. We had some issues while merging our code in GitHub. But with some googling and help from the team members, we were able to fix the issue and by the end of the day had a working site.

The project was a great and impressive learning experience. Even though the task was similar to that of the last unit, the application of new concepts like promises allowed us to build better websites than those before and also showed the ease with which the work could be done now. We still had new elements that had to search for and explored and I am grateful for the opportunity to learn and grow. I will be grabbing all such opportunities that come my way and also seek to make my own such opportunities as well as I move on to being a better developer.
